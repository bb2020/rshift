* Rshift

Manual screen temperature management service for macOS based on [[https://github.com/jonls/redshift][Redshift]].

** Configuration

- Reads config from =rshift.json=.
- You must provide =12:00 AM= key in your config.

** Remarks

- It breaks on wake or visiting display settings.\\
  =rshift= refreshes every 15 seconds so just wait for a few seconds and it will fix itself.
- Do not use =redshift= and =rshift= services simultaneously.\\
  You can still use =redshift= in manual mode.
